# Project

This is a full stack project.

Frontend Build Up using the HTML/CSS/JS/ReactJS ----> code is there

For Backend I used NodeJS/ExpressJS and for the database I used Microsoft Azure SQL Database.

Thus out of MERN Stack this project uses the 'ERN'. The code of backend is also there. Rest the Azure Database can be seen from the Github Student Developer Pack, as I used it to get Azure for FREE,Hanuman
